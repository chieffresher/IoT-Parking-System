# IoT Parking System
 Smart parking solution using IoT systems. Sensors used are Passive Infrared sensor (PIR) and Ultrasonic sensor.
A parking slot has both sensors to detect the presence of an object or living being within the location of interest.
The pir sensors job is to help determine whether the thing within the location is living or not. If it is living being
then the slot is assumed available but unsave to enter.
